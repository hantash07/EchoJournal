## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

Building Echo Journal strengthened my understanding of full-stack Android app development with **modern Jetpack tools**.  

Key areas of learning include:

- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for reactive, asynchronous data handling  
- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative and dynamic UI design  
- **Room Database** for local persistence and caching  
- **MVVM + Repository Architecture** for clean, scalable structure  
- **Android Audio Recording APIs** for capturing and storing voice notes  
- **Dependency Injection (Koin)** for cleaner and testable code  
- **Material 3 Design** for a modern, user-friendly interface
